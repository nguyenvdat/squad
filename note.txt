Depthwise separable convolution 1d in pytorch
- Apply 2 conv1d layers on top of each other
- The first one perform depthwise by setting group = inChannel and outChannel = inChannel (having each filter for each char
  embedding dimension while preserve the input channel.
- The second one perform pointwise convolution by setting kernel size = 1 and outChannel = e_word
- idx 1 is OOV (out of vocabulary), 0 is PAD
